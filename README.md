# Clima ‚òÅ

## My Goal

Using asynchronous programming in Dart to carry out time consuming tasks such as getting device location and networking to get data from the internet.
The project involved networking with Dart http package, consuming APIs /in this case a weather data API), parsing JSON data base type
and using Navigator among screens within the application.

Also using knowledge from flutter widget life cycle, Geolocator package, Textfield for receive inputs.
Finally catching and printing error from vulnerable points within the code was implemented.

Design inspired by the beautiful designs made by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-).
By the end of the module, you'll be able to find out the live weather data in the current location of the device as well as the weather for any city you can think of!
